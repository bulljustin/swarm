# ── Holder version-skew detection ───────────────────────────────────
#
# The holder is a double-forked persistent sidecar. Once spawned, its
# bytecode never refreshes — not on daemon reload, not on os.execv, not
# even if the operator reinstalls the swarm tool. The only way to adopt
# a holder.py change is to explicitly kill + respawn the holder process.
#
# This happened in production: commit 0df45be raised
# ``_MAX_WRITE_BUFFER`` 1 MB → 8 MB on 2026-04-21 to fix the reload
# lockup, but the fix sat unapplied for days because the holder had been
# running since April 5. Every dashboard Reload refreshed the daemon and
# immediately got dropped again as a "slow client" by the stale holder.
#
# Drift detection makes that invisible failure loud: on every successful
# connect, the pool asks the holder for its import-time source hash and
# compares against ``holder.py`` on disk. A mismatch is logged at
# WARNING level and surfaced via ``pool.holder_drift`` for the daemon
# health endpoint.
